# User Interface

This files are the editable screens of the app.
UI skeleton, buttons and backgrounds have been split into multiple PNG files in order to be combined at runtime and exported into the `Assets` folder.
Since the UI does not automatically streches to any screen geometry or resolution, you might need these SVG files to match your hardware specs and re-export PNGs into assets.

* Fonts `Roboto` and `Vintage Avalanche` are needed
* SVG files generated by inkscape 0.91
